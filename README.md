# AV-efi — User Stories (Issues)

This repository collects project-wide user stories, epics and related discussion for the AV-efi project. Each entry in this repository is represented as a GitHub Issue and follows a lightweight convention:

- Issue title: a short identifier and summary (e.g. "RD-01: Rollen- & Rechteverwaltung ...").
- Labels: indicate type (UserStory), area (Frontend / Backend), priority (MUSTHAVE / WONTHAVE), and epic grouping (e.g. Epic:Redaktion).
- Issue body: contains acceptance criteria, context and implementation notes when available.

Purpose
- Provide a single, versioned place that lists user stories and epics for product planning.
- Make requirements discoverable and linkable from other repositories, design docs, and sprint boards.
- Serve as the source of truth for feature scope and priorities.

How to use
- Browse issues: https://github.com/AV-EFI/AVefi-Issues/issues
- Filter by label (e.g. "Epic:Redaktion", "UserStory", "Backend") to see related stories.
- Link commits, PRs or other issues to a story by referencing the issue number (e.g. #129).

Contributing
- Open a new issue for a new user story, using the existing prefix convention (e.g. "NC-xx", "RD-xx", "BR-xx", ...).
- When editing or refining a story, update the issue body with clear acceptance criteria and mark readiness with labels.
- Tag one or more maintainers for review when the story is ready to be implemented.

Notes and caveats
- The issues are actively used to plan frontend, backend, data quality, export and editorial features. Many issues are in German to match the project context.
- If you need a canonical roadmap or sprint assignment, check the associated planning board or the main AV-efi repositories.

Contact / Maintainers
- Maintained by the AV-efi team. For questions, mention @steffolino or open an issue.
